# webcoat
Note: I have to amend this text. <br>

`webcoat` stands for collection of automation tool for web.
It's attempt to collect most demanded projecst on freelance market. Currently
web is most popular field, so most of projects will be for web services.
From time to time I observe freelance field for changes and bring more functionality
to my project. <br>

You can use open source and don't pay damn programmers on freelance. When I'll 
have success there, I cut freelancers' payments off. Web programming it's the
easiest (weakest) field of programming. And if you're programmer who knows several languages, 
high abstructed tools and doesn't even heard of C, U suck. ha-ha. Fuck it. <br>

I'm gonna make money using these sheet. So let's how good at it I'll be.
