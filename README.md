# webcoat

Note: I have to amend this text.
It's attempt to collect most demanded projecst on freelance market. Currently
web is most popular field, so most of projects will be for web services.
From time to time I observe freelance field for changes and bring functionality
to my project.

You can use open source and don't pay damn-programmers on freelance. If I'll 
success at it, then it cut someone's payments on there. ha-ha. Fuck it.
